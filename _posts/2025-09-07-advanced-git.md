Collaboration is fundemental skill required in workspaces, thus it is critical for programmers to grasp tooling that streamlines productivity while dealing in stressful and tedious collaboration. Git stands as the most popular source controlling tool, yet many programmers lack adequate skills to harness its full potential.
