In today's fast-moving world of software development, collaboration without friction and quick delivery are not an option. This session introduces Git as the foundation of version control and DevOps as the cultural and technical practice that bridges development and operations.

DevOps practices are crucial because they help teams ship code faster, catch bugs early, and keep everything running smoothly even when many people are working on the same project at the same time. Bad DevOps can stick even the best code in long review cycles or break it in production. Participants learn basic workflows, branching strategies, CI/CD, automation, and infrastructure as code to speed up teamwork and reduce errors in real projects.
