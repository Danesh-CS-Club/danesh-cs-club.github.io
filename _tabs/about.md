## About Danesh Computer Science Club

The Iranian education system has long overlooked social skills that are essential for success in modern work environments. Danesh Computer Science Club was started to fix that gap. We focus on creative thinking through interactive and team-based experiences, helping young minds learn to collaborate effectively and strengthen communication skills — cultivating pioneers of the future.

Humanity has always thrived by collaborative learning. That's why we hold bi-weekly gatherings where members educate each other on core programming concepts. Sessions are 2.5 hours long, divided into segments presented by different people. We also plan hackathons — 24-hour grinds to innovate and build together, just like real developer teams do.

This is a call for change. We aim to develop personal and professional growth, build great leaders and thinkers. Participation requires fundamental programming knowledge, but mutual education is encouraged for everyone. Presenters or active participants go through a simple evaluation test.

All notes and writings are in English (for internationalization), but conferences are held in Farsi with provided subtitles. Sessions are saved and uploaded (video + text notes).

**Benefits of joining:**
- Meaningful intellectual environment where ideas get promoted
- Hands-on experience that enhances future career prospects
- Access to all saved lectures and group projects

Supported by Danesh High Schools.
